    <h1>Introducing: New OAC</h1>
    <p>Welcome to the new OAC website! We’re excited to introduce you to our upgraded OAC website, completely rebuilt using current and well-supported technology. However, things might look a little different from what you’re used to. We’ve prepared a few videos to help you get to know the new OAC! We hope you love it as much as we do.</p>

<h2 id="search">Search OAC</h2>
<p>In this video, we highlight options to search across OAC’s sitewide contents. In OAC, you can discover over 60,000 collection guides - and counting!</p>

<p>OAC additionally offers options to search within a particular institution, or even within a specific collection guide. The search features demonstrated in this video are available at each of these different levels, and function similarly across the site.<p>

<h2 id="institutions">Browse Contributing Institutions</h2>
<p>This video introduces options to browse contributing institutions and search their specific collections.</p>

<p>OAC partners with over 350 libraries, archives, and museums throughout California. Our contributing partners steward primary sources, which are organized into collections - these collections are described in collection guides, which offer summary information about the collection, as well as the type of records you might find.</p>

<h2 id="collections">Navigate Collection Guides</h2>
<p>In this video, we take a look at an example of a typical collection guide in OAC, highlight key features available to navigate or search through the guide, and what you can do if you want to view a particular historical resource or use it in your research.</p>
