Oral histories have been conducted and produced by Department volunteers, the Caltrans History Preservation Committee, and the District 3 History Committee since 1978. The &quot;Highway Recollections&quot; series consists of tape recordings and published transcriptions of interviews with retired engineers, highway maintenance workers, administrators, and other personnel who have shared their insights on past highway development and changes within the Department. All available recordings in this series have been digitized and are available via streaming.   In the wake of the October 17, 1989 Loma Prieta Earthquake, Caltrans commissioned an oral history project to document the personal and professional experiences of 258 Caltrans employees who worked to restore the State's damaged transportation system. Caltrans staff in District 4 initiated the “Loma Prieta” project. It was organized quickly and informally with interviews completed within three months of the earthquake while their memories were fresh. The interviews cover a cross section of job titles and geographic areas to better illustrate the size and scope of the disaster.   Currently, only a small portion of the original 258 interviews have been digitalized, but Caltrans library currently is working in partnership with the California Audiovisual Preservation Project (CAVPP) to digitalize all the recordings."

    description: "The Center for Oral and Public History (COPH)—a component of the Department of History and the College of Humanities and Social Sciences at California State University, Fullerton—embraces a three-fold mission. First, COPH collects and preserves the stories of distinctive individuals and diverse communities whose historical experiences have shaped the collective memory of Southern California, defined national and transnational identities, and reflected life in an era of globalization. Second, COPH undertakes and provides support services for public history projects, particularly those designed to share oral histories with public audiences in Southern California and beyond. Third, COPH trains CSUF students in the research methods of collecting oral histories, interpreting these histories, and presenting important regional, national, and global stories to the public. Ultimately, COPH seeks to combine the strengths of oral history and public history in order to build better connections between Cal State Fullerton and the communities—local, national, and global—to which it is tied.  With more than 5,000 recorded interviews and related transcripts, photographs, and other materials, COPH maintains the largest oral history archive in the state of California. The collection stands out nationally for its grassroots nature and the wide range of communities represented. The genesis of this archive came with the creation of a student-driven oral history program at Cal State Fullerton in 1968. Today, we continue to train students to create oral histories and generate new collections. We recognize that certain obligations accompany ownership of these collections, in particular the maintenance of a suitable storage environment and access for users, including students, scholars, educators, community members, journalists, filmmakers, and policy makers. We endeavor to employ the most appropriate, up-to-date technologies to achieve both of these ends."

The emotional quality and authenticity of home movies combined with interactive media arts engagement has the power to engender and transcend notions of history and memory on greater communal and individual levels. Through Memories to Light: Asian American Home Movies, the power of collective memory and media will bring to life the experiences of Asian American communities in California, spanning six decades (1920s through the 1980s) of the 20th Century. This truly unique arts experience  collectively and aesthetically constructs shared social, cultural, and political representations of Asian America directly from the community itself. At the heart of this project is how collective memory can be amassed and sustained through transmedia and interactive participation."

These collections are held in the public trust and reflect the many aspects of the social, political, geographic, and cultural history of the Sacramento region.&lt;br&gt;  The collections held at CSH include both three-dimensional museum artifacts and archival records (public documents, and manuscripts and personal papers). The Center's museum collections document Sacramento material culture –the tools employed, the clothing worn, the art enjoyed –and showcase the great diversity that calls the region home.  Within the archival collections are the official records of City and County government and the Superior Court of Sacramento County, and manuscript collections of prominent individuals, families, businesses, organizations, and community groups of the Sacramento region. The Center thus serves as a &quot;total archive&quot; in documenting all aspects of the city and county's history. CSH's holdings are open for research and available for display at accredited institutions that meet the center's security and environmental requirements."

    description: "The Center for the Critical Study of the Health of Latinx Communities (Critical Study HLC) is a project established in 2023 under the auspices of UC Berkeley’s Latinx Research Center, that aims to document the rich history of contributions by Latinx-based social movements to justice in health initiated by Dr. Clara Mantini-Briggs, MD, MPH, and Professor Charles L. Briggs (University of California, Berkeley) in 2022. With funding from the California Legislature, the Center was established to document the unrepresented histories of the struggle of the Latinx and Chicanx communities for justice in health and quality of life–meaning housing, access to healthcare services, labor conditions, education, etc. Preserving this history is part of how we hope to reframe and challenge the systemic roots of health inequities in the Latinx community.   The Center’s collection consists of interviews and conversations with Latinx community members and allies who made an impact in the struggle for accessible and quality healthcare, were active in social movements, or dedicated their careers and lives to serving the community. These diverse oral histories and recorded conversations provide glimpses into the Chicanx movement, farmworker movement, and civic efforts that aimed to address the health needs of the Latinx community from the 1960s to the present."

A child's shoe from the death camp Majdanek; a brief case used to carry false documents for Jewish children in hiding; a poem written by a boy in Terezin, all transform history into stories through which we can engage and learn. Recent gifts include the collection of Holocaust survivor and rescuer Curt Lowens and a self-portrait by Josef Nassy, a black expatriate artist of Jewish descent interned in camps in Belgium and Germany."

As of January 28, 2025,  California Historical Society  collections have been transferred to Stanford University Libraries, following the CHS Board of Trustees resolution to dissolve the organization. SUL is committed to carrying on CHS’s core mission of preserving and sharing the history of California and the West. The agreement between CHS and SUL, which was unanimously supported by the CHS Board of Trustees and reviewed by the California Attorney General’s Office as part of the California nonprofit dissolution process, provides that the collection will remain intact under the expert care of SUL’s extensive preservation and archives staff. This ensures that the CHS Collection will continue to be publicly accessible for future generations to appreciate.    Read the entire press release here: https://library.stanford.edu/news/stanford-university-assume-stewardship-california-historical-society-collection  CHS Collections will be temporarily unavailable as SUL works to accession them and transfer and update records."

The mission of the Museum is to collect, preserve, and interpret objects and information related to the cultural and natural history of Inyo County and the Eastern Sierra, from Death Valley to Mono Lake. The Museum collection is held in public trust, and a computerized database with over 15,550 records is used to manage the Museum's extensive collections. In addition to those artifacts, the Museum also houses about 27,000 historic photographs of the Eastern Sierra region, the majority of which date from the late 1800s through the 1950s. The Museum is also an outstanding resource for researchers, and typically handles about 200 requests for information or photo reprints per year. Artifacts and information are interpreted for the public through the Museum's permanent exhibits and an annual rotating, special exhibit from the collection. The Museum also maintains archives that make up the History Files, and the Family Files, both of which contain newspaper clippings, original documents, and other information about the towns, people, and subjects that have played a role in the history of Inyo County and the Eastern Sierra. The Frank M. Parcher Research Library is another excellent source of information for researchers and the general public. The Museum also presents educational programs, special events, and lectures and talks that are free and open to the public. In addition to the main Museum buildings at the Museum's Independence campus, the Eastern California Museum also maintains the historic Commander's House and Edwards House in Independence, and the Mary DeDecker Native Plant Garden on the Museum grounds. The Eastern Californian Museum, located at 155 N. Grant St. in Independence, is open daily and weekends (except major holidays) and admission is free, although donations are appreciated."

We are also in the process of scanning and cataloging thousands of historical documents, pamphlets, journals, newspapers, and other print materials from many radical organizations and movements which enrich our media holdings. The digitized materials in our archives are free for use and constitute a compelling record of 50 years of recorded sound, images and cultural diversity. The collections are an invaluable resource for young people and students, teachers, diverse community organizations, filmmakers, activists, historians, artists, media outlets, and researchers.

    description: "Special Collections at the Los Angeles Public Library include a wide variety of rare and unique items: archival collections, photographs, maps, rare books, prints, artists' books, periodicals, newspapers, pamphlets, broadsides, travel posters, restaurant menus, fashion plates, book plates, fruit crate labels, manuscripts and much more. The rare books at Central Library includes over 22,000 monographs, predominantly in English and Spanish, dating from the 15th century, with the majority published in the 18th and 19th centuries. Archival collections include the Brockman Gallery Archive, the Lydia R. Otero Archive, and the Bill Press Collection of materials relating to Black Sparrow Press and Charles Bukowski.  Central Library's History Department began collecting photographs sometime before World War II and had a collection of about 13,000 images by the late 1950s. In 1981, when Los Angeles celebrated its 200th birthday, Security Pacific National Bank gave its noted collection of 250,000 historical photographs to the people of Los Angeles to be archived at the Central Library. Since then, the Central Library has been fortunate to receive other major collections and special archives, making the Library a resource worldwide for visual images.  There are over 200,000 Maps in Central Library's collection, one of the largest in American public libraries. The collection also includes some 2,000 atlases, over 1,000 gazetteers, some 20 serial titles and over one thousand books supporting the study of maps and mapping. The emphasis of this collection is on Los Angeles, Southern California and California but in many cases the scope extends to national and international coverage. The great majority of the chronological scope is post-1900 but there is a representation of 19th century maps in California."

In response to these areas of need, the Open Heritage 3D project was developed to make primary 3D cultural heritage data open and accessible and remove the barriers for content producers to publish their data. CyArk along with other founding organizations Historic Environment Scotland and the University of South Florida Libraries committed in 2019 to make available their significant repositories of data from legacy as well as new 3D documentation projects. Since then other organizations have joined the initiative, contributing over 200 datasets and we invite others to join the Open Heritage 3D project and contribute their datasets to this growing library of data."

Chronicling the political, cultural and artistic movements of the second half of the 20th century, Pacifica radio programs include documentaries, performances, discussions, debates, drama, poetry readings, commentaries and radio arts. The Pacifica Radio Archives appraise, collect, organize, describe, and preserve the creative work generated by, or produced in association with, Pacifica Radio, and make it available for research and reference use.  The Archives is delighted to be a part of the California Audiovisual Preservation Project (CAVPP). The two oldest Pacifica Radio sister stations, KPFA-FM and KPFK-FM, are based in Berkeley and Los Angeles, respectively. Over the past sixty years, KPFA and KPFK have borne witness to events in both Northern and Southern California, and have prominently featured the voices of California denizens and community members who were often excluded from both local and national news media. The Archives' CAVPP collection features actuality from mass demonstrations such as People's Park Protest and the International Hotel evictions; incisive public affairs programming about issues that affected Californians of the time, such as the passage of Proposition 13, farm workers' strikes, and racial segregation in urban communities; interviews with politicians, artists and countercultural figures; and much more. Many of these recordings have not been heard since their initial broadcast on Pacifica airwaves."

The Digital Archive is a component of the Saddleback College Library. Responsibility for collection development rests with the faculty librarians.  The Digital Archive collects material relevant to Saddleback College and its history. Collections consist primarily of official college documents, including institutional publications, reports, and communications, as well as oral histories, photographs, and other first-hand accounts of campus life and events at the college. The Digital Archive does not serve as a repository of student research, nor does it collect regional material that does not speak directly to the history of Saddleback College. The faculty librarians reserve the right to adjust the scope of the Digital Archive as needed."

A majority of the collection contains recorded oral interviews with people who personally knew John Steinbeck and are recounting their memories with him. Other material includes film from the Steinbeck Festival XIII in 1995.  The Salinas Public Library has proudly served the community since 1909 when it first opened its doors as a Carnegie Public Library. Today, there are three branch libraries, John Steinbeck Library, Cesar Chavez Library, and El Gabilan Library, with services available 7-days a week. The collection includes more than 100,000 books, magazines, movies, and audiobooks, and a separate Steinbeck Collection of more than a thousand books, articles, and historical items.  In 2005, the library was featured in the movie “The Hollywood Librarian” after it received national attention for nearly closing its doors because of severe budget cuts. Rally Salinas, a local and regional effort to restore funding for the library through a local tax measure, was ultimately successful in sustaining operations. Today, the Salinas Public Library is experiencing a renaissance of programs and services with its recent launch of a Digital Branch that includes an extensive collection of online resources, databases, instructional software, as well as eBooks, eMagazines, streaming movies, and much more."

As the decision-making body for countywide issues, much of that history has been shaped by the Board of Supervisors. Through their firsthand documents, photos, and recordings, this digital collection provides a unique view into Santa Clara County’s incredible past through the eyes the elected officials chosen to lead the region. In 2011, County Supervisor Dave Cortese created the County Archives Taskforce comprised of former County Supervisors. The Taskforce created a pilot website. This interactive digital collection builds on that work, providing an expanded database of thousands of firsthand documents, photos, videos, and other multimedia. A work in constant progress, the size of the collection will continue to grow as more materials are processed.  We hope you enjoy this peek into the work of former Santa Clara County Supervisors and the notable policies and initiatives they championed. The contents of this site are intended for educational purposes only. Please contact the Records Unit of the Clerk of the Santa Clara County Board of Supervisors for other uses."

Since that time, they have travelled the world supporting small and large organizations in integrating the Digital Storytelling methods into their engagement efforts.  StoryCenter has worked with nearly a thousand organizations around the world and trained more than fifteen thousand people in hundreds of workshops to share stories from their lives. Through our wide-ranging work, we have transformed the way that community activists, educators, health and human services agencies, business professionals, and artists think about the power of personal voice, in creating change.  In 2016, we were invited by State Librarian Greg Lucas and the California State Library to travel the State of California collecting stories of residents through their local public libraries. The California Listens project collected these 106 stories in 2016 from 12 libraries, and will add an additional 100+ stories from 24 additional libraries in 2017 and 2018."

We fully embrace the notion that a public institution can lead in shaping and defining disciplines, not just teaching them. We contribute to this mission by investing in a strong faculty and talented and ambitious graduate students from a variety of backgrounds. Our faculty is drawn from disciplines as diverse as anthropology, cultural studies, linguistics, literature, history, sociology, performance, and education. But we are not simply a collection of experts from traditional disciplines; we are united by a relentless commitment to pushing the boundaries of knowledge through excellence in scholarship and pedagogy that are at once interdisciplinary and innovative."

The collection is strong in student protest literature, particularly in the form of leaflets, and in student publications generally. In addition to printed materials and administrative records, University Archives includes holdings in other formats: pictorial, maps, audio-visual, and memorabilia. The collection largely dates from the founding of the University in 1868, although it contains some materials pertaining to the College of California (1855-1868). The collection began as a repository of University of California printed documents in the mid 1870s; it was finally designated as repository of University administrative records of historical importance in 1964. The collection consists, with very few exceptions, of English language material."

    name: "UC Irvine, Southeast Asian Archive"
    description: "The University of California, Irvine Libraries established the Southeast Asian Archive in 1987 in response to the community’s interest in having this history documented, preserved, and made accessible. The Archive's collection is broad and interdisciplinary in documenting the social, cultural, religious, political, and economic life of members of the Cambodian, Hmong, Laotian, and Vietnamese diaspora. Collection strengths include Southeast Asian American experiences of resettlement and community formations since the Vietnam War, Cambodian Genocide, and geopolitical turmoil in the former French-occupied &quot;Indochina&quot; in the latter half of the 20th century.  The circumstances related to the formation of these diasporic communities, including wars, genocide, and displacement, contribute to the complexities of the Southeast Asian Archive. In particular, records from international aid workers may include information about people who were unknowingly (or non-consentingly) documented and/or depict or describe graphic violence, nudity, as well as racist and/or sexist views. Additionally, these communities originate from countries previously colonized by France and named “Indochina.” As such, some records deploy terms that may be common in government and scholarly publications, but are not adopted or agreed upon by Cambodian, Hmong, Laotian, and Vietnamese people.  These primary source collections are historical and may include descriptive language, personal views, and imagery about and/or in them that are no longer used or considered appropriate today. The acceptability of language and content can change over time. It is possible that a collection or metadata associated with a collection may contain historical language or culturally sensitive content now recognized as inappropriate for publication without meaningful context or consultation with relevant communities.  We are proactively addressing these issues in the UCI Libraries, including ongoing work on reparative, ethical archival description. If you believe that we have archival materials or have published an image or information that is incorrect or that should be restricted, please submit feedback using this form: https://airtable.com/shrOmDhHMDUFlhBVd"

In the fall of 2016, under a memorandum of understanding with the University of California’s Division of Agriculture and Natural Resources, the UC Merced Library began to assess, inventory, process, and provide access to historical materials held in county Cooperative Extension offices. Records in the county offices document agricultural trials, animal husbandry, water management, fire management, the development of integrated pest management, rural food and nutrition programs, and youth development programs, among other subjects. The records reflect the partnership between the university and federal, state, and local entities."

During the flu epidemic of 1918, the hospital treated 100-plus patients a day, and in the 1940s, it provided care to thousands of Jewish refugees. In 1976, the hospital opened the first alternative birth center in San Francisco, and 10 years later opened the city’s first hospital-based comprehensive women’s health center. Mount Zion Hospital began its association with the University of California in the late 1920s, when its medical services expanded significantly and it became a teaching hospital affiliated with UC Medical School (later named UCSF School of Medicine). UCSF acquired the hospital in 1990 and developed the facility over the next few years into a second major clinical site, with an emphasis on outpatient care, under the name UCSF Medical Center at Mount Zion. The UCSF Mount Zion campus serves as an innovative hub of specialized outpatient clinics, surgery, services and comprehensive cancer care."

The Manuscript Collection exists to complement the official holdings of institutional records housed in the Archives. While the collection is not strictly restricted by subject, these materials will usually encompass the following broad subject matter: the practice and science of medicine; biomedical research; healthcare delivery, economics, and administration; health professions education; operations and history of UCSF, its schools, program, and affiliated partners as appropriate; alumni collections including club memorabilia, diaries, photographs, reunion books and scrapbooks. UCSF has the preeminent collection documenting the history of HIV/AIDS epidemic that was started through the UCSF AIDS History Project in 1987 and has been growing even since. The Biotechnology Archives document the leadership of scientists and corporations in the Bay Area in the development and growth of biotechnology. The East Asian Collection is especially strong in works related to the history of Western medicine in Japan from the middle of the 16th century to 1900. It also holds books and journals related to the history of medical societies and medical and pharmacy schools in Japan. Other areas of strength include traditional Chinese medicine, Buddhist medicine, obstetrics and gynecology, and acupuncture. The Japanese Woodblock Print Collection consists of 400 prints and 100 scrolls, dating from 16th to the 20th century."

    description: "Based in the Little Tokyo area of Downtown Los Angeles, the Visual Communications Archives is a repository of 20th Century Asian Pacific American history with unique holdings of photographs, moving image, and oral histories. The holdings include over 300,000 photographic images, 1,500 titles in the Media Resource Library, 100 films and videos produced by Visual Communications, and over 1,000 hours of oral histories. The VC Archives is unique due to the diversity of its collections in pan-Asian content in a variety of formats and subjects.  The Visual Communications collective documented various Asian American social movements and communities in California. Members of Visual Communications not only captured the impassioned times of the movement; their work became an innovative and natural part of the movement as well. Films and videos were used for education and activism that addressed setting up ethnic studies programs on local campuses, city redevelopment issues, the redress campaign for Japanese Americans interned during World War II, and the declaration of martial law in the Philippines. VC’s own past in all media, narrative films, documentaries and educational projects are intertwined with the Asian Pacific American movements of the 1970s, and in itself represents a rich resource for researchers of the Asian Pacific American movements.  The holdings’ focus on Asian Pacific communities here in the U.S., though specific, affirms a culturally pluralistic view of American society. This view resides in the heart of VC’s mission — to promote intercultural understanding through the preservation of our cultures, communities, and histories in America. To date, VC materials have been used in numerous films, videos, educational materials, publications, and major photographic exhibits across the U.S.  For more information, please visit: http://fromthevcvault.wordpress.com/vc-archives-collections/"

The Wende fulfills its mission by:             • collecting, preserving, and providing open access to artwork, artifacts, archives, films, and personal histories from the Cold War; • promoting rigorous scholarship, educating students, and stimulating general interest through lectures, symposia, publications, and the digitization of collection material; • presenting innovative exhibitions and interdisciplinary programming inspired by the collection;  • facilitating collaborations with contemporary artists and researchers; • partnering with other non-profit organizations; and • providing community services such as wellness programs, volunteer opportunities, and family- friendly activities.&quot;"

    description: "The Sierra Club has maintained a library since its beginnings more than a century ago. The Club's first library was based on a small collection of mountaineering literature that served John Muir and other mountaineers at the turn of the twentieth century. In San Francisco's devastating 1906 earthquake and fire, this early collection was destroyed, but the library was soon reestablished through an outpouring of donations. From those small beginnings the library has grown to accommodate the evolving needs of Sierra Club members. As the Club grew, so did its library. It now holds a significant conservation and mountaineering collection. In 1965, the Library was dedicated as a memorial to William E. Colby , the first secretary of the Sierra Club and a director for forty-nine years. As a reference library, ours is a non-circulating, research collection. Sierra Club members and the public are welcome to use the library as visitors, by appointment. In our reading room at the Club's San Francisco headquarters, we provide on-site access to our extensive collection of books, periodicals, mountaineering journals, government documents, historic photographs, slides, maps and memorabilia. Researchers who are unable to visit our library may search the online catalog  for our traditional collections. We respond to reference inquiries regarding Sierra Club publications and history, and will provide photocopies of specific articles if needed. In the 21st century, the Colby Library has expanded online. Our mission is to bring more great content from the Club's website to the library's holdings."

The museum aims to provide the community a broad collection of reference materials that document women’s history and the female experience.    With approximately 4,000 works in the Library Collection, the interdisciplinary nature concerning women’s history is reflected in our holdings - offering resources on a wide variety of disciplines such as women in the arts, women’s health &amp; reproductive rights, women in the military, biographical works, LGBT studies, law &amp; politics, and seminal works on the first and second waves of the feminist movement.  The majority of the Library Collection is comprised of printed works including books, journals, and periodicals. A small collection of audio-visual materials are available, including early sound recordings (vinyl) and our oral history collection that includes interviews from prominent women in the Unitarian Universalist Church and San Diego’s Hall of Fame Inductees.  The Women’s Museum of California also houses a historically significant Special Collection containing rare and out-of-print volumes dating from the mid-1800s.  A prized collection is a first edition set of Susan B. Anthony’s and Ida Husted Harper’s “The History of Women’s Suffrage,” the only known first edition to exist in California.   The Women's Museum of California's Archival Collection houses nearly 300 linear feet of material documenting the life and work of prominent female leaders and organizations' commitment to women's rights and representation.  The Archival Collection includes the first women’s studies program developed at San Diego State University, collections from U.N. Conferences on the Status of Women, the National Organization for Women (N.O.W.), the Older Women’s League (O.W.L.), California Women for Agriculture, Women’s International League for Peace and Freedom (W.I.L.P.F.), National League of American Pen Women, League of Women Voters, National Women’s Political Caucus, the American Association of University Women, and finally Planned Parenthood and the Women’s Care Clinic of San Diego.  The personal papers and archival collections of prominent women include our founder, Mary Maschal; California suffragist sympathizer, Alice Park; Nancy Reeves; former California Senator, Lucy Killea; and Alice Barnes."
