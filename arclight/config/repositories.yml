As founder and president of the Albany Historical Society, Ms. Webb documented the history of Albany for more than sixty years. In January 1994, to coincide with the opening of the new library building, she donated the entire collection of the Historical Society to the Albany Library, where it is displayed in a special alcove designed to house it.Since then, several other members of the community have donated additional materials to the library&#x27;s collection, and the Friends of the Albany Library have generously supported the microfilming of the entire local newspaper collection."

    description: "The Center for Oral and Public History (COPH)—a component of the Department of History and the College of Humanities and Social Sciences at California State University, Fullerton—embraces a three-fold mission. First, COPH collects and preserves the stories of distinctive individuals and diverse communities whose historical experiences have shaped the collective memory of Southern California, defined national and transnational identities, and reflected life in an era of globalization. Second, COPH undertakes and provides support services for public history projects, particularly those designed to share oral histories with public audiences in Southern California and beyond. Third, COPH trains CSUF students in the research methods of collecting oral histories, interpreting these histories, and presenting important regional, national, and global stories to the public. Ultimately, COPH seeks to combine the strengths of oral history and public history in order to build better connections between Cal State Fullerton and the communities—local, national, and global—to which it is tied.  With more than 5,000 recorded interviews and related transcripts, photographs, and other materials, COPH maintains the largest oral history archive in the state of California. The collection stands out nationally for its grassroots nature and the wide range of communities represented. The genesis of this archive came with the creation of a student-driven oral history program at Cal State Fullerton in 1968. Today, we continue to train students to create oral histories and generate new collections. We recognize that certain obligations accompany ownership of these collections, in particular the maintenance of a suitable storage environment and access for users, including students, scholars, educators, community members, journalists, filmmakers, and policy makers. We endeavor to employ the most appropriate, up-to-date technologies to achieve both of these ends."

These collections are held in the public trust and reflect the many aspects of the social, political, geographic, and cultural history of the Sacramento region.&lt;br&gt;  The collections held at CSH include both three-dimensional museum artifacts and archival records (public documents, and manuscripts and personal papers). The Center&#x27;s museum collections document Sacramento material culture –the tools employed, the clothing worn, the art enjoyed –and showcase the great diversity that calls the region home.  Within the archival collections are the official records of City and County government and the Superior Court of Sacramento County, and manuscript collections of prominent individuals, families, businesses, organizations, and community groups of the Sacramento region. The Center thus serves as a &quot;total archive&quot; in documenting all aspects of the city and county&#x27;s history. CSH&#x27;s holdings are open for research and available for display at accredited institutions that meet the center&#x27;s security and environmental requirements."

    description: "Dedicated by Nobel Peace Prize laureate, Elie Wiesel on April 11, 2005, the 60th anniversary of his liberation from Buchenwald, the Sala and Aron Samueli Holocaust Memorial Library is located on the 4th floor of the Leatherby Libraries. The library is a gift of Henry and Susan Samueli and is named in honor of Mr. Samueli&#x27;s parents, both of whom were Holocaust survivors. It includes the Joyce and Saul Brandman Survivors Room, made possible by a gift from The Brandman Foundation.  The library&#x27;s permanent and rotating exhibits tell of the individual lives affected, and all too often ended, by the Holocaust. A child&#x27;s shoe from the death camp Majdanek; a brief case used to carry false documents for Jewish children in hiding; a poem written by a boy in Terezin, all transform history into stories through which we can engage and learn. Recent gifts include the collection of Holocaust survivor and rescuer Curt Lowens and a self-portrait by Josef Nassy, a black expatriate artist of Jewish descent interned in camps in Belgium and Germany."

Offering a youth development program focused on engagement with these historical materials and providing media production training, we also produce original documentaries and educational resources for use by schools and organizations as tools for community building and social justice work.    The materials housed at the Freedom Archives—over 12,000 hours of audio and video recordings—include: weekly news, poetry, music programs; in-depth interviews and reports on social and cultural issues; numerous voices from behind prison walls and recordings of diverse demonstrations and activists. We are also in the process of scanning and cataloging thousands of historical documents, pamphlets, journals, newspapers, and other print materials from many radical organizations and movements which enrich our media holdings. The digitized materials in our archives are free for use and constitute a compelling record of 50 years of recorded sound, images and cultural diversity. The collections are an invaluable resource for young people and students, teachers, diverse community organizations, filmmakers, activists, historians, artists, media outlets, and researchers.    In order to maintain our values and our commitment to illuminating marginalized voices and uplifting stories of resistance, the Freedom Archives does not take any money from government or corporate sources and our budget is comprised of small grants, family funds, and— most importantly—individual donations."

    description: "The mission of the Los Angeles Poverty Department (LAPD) is to connect the experiences of people living in poverty to the sociopolitical forces that shape their lives and communities through multidisciplinary artworks, performances, exhibitions, and public conversations, while addressing their concerns collaboratively with the Skid Row community.   In 2015, LAPD opened the Skid Row History Museum &amp; Archive (SRHMA) due to lack of space for community members’ creative and civic activity. SRHMA maintains the only publicly accessible community archive documenting the 50+ year history of activism and agency in Skid Row. Comprised of an estimated 20,000+ materials including recorded interviews, performances, photographs, and printed materials, the archive represents the lived experience of Skid Row leaders, residents, activists, artists, and service providers. Across these decades, LAPD’s work has been a bulwark against the displacement of Skid Row. As we look ahead to the next decade, we are focused on sustaining this impact to ensure the community’s continued survival and cultural vibrancy."

    description: "Special Collections at the Los Angeles Public Library include a wide variety of rare and unique items: archival collections, photographs, maps, rare books, prints, artists&#x27; books, periodicals, newspapers, pamphlets, broadsides, travel posters, restaurant menus, fashion plates, book plates, fruit crate labels, manuscripts and much more. The rare books at Central Library includes over 22,000 monographs, predominantly in English and Spanish, dating from the 15th century, with the majority published in the 18th and 19th centuries. Archival collections include the Brockman Gallery Archive, the Lydia R. Otero Archive, and the Bill Press Collection of materials relating to Black Sparrow Press and Charles Bukowski.  Central Library&#x27;s History Department began collecting photographs sometime before World War II and had a collection of about 13,000 images by the late 1950s. In 1981, when Los Angeles celebrated its 200th birthday, Security Pacific National Bank gave its noted collection of 250,000 historical photographs to the people of Los Angeles to be archived at the Central Library. Since then, the Central Library has been fortunate to receive other major collections and special archives, making the Library a resource worldwide for visual images.  There are over 200,000 Maps in Central Library&#x27;s collection, one of the largest in American public libraries. The collection also includes some 2,000 atlases, over 1,000 gazetteers, some 20 serial titles and over one thousand books supporting the study of maps and mapping. The emphasis of this collection is on Los Angeles, Southern California and California but in many cases the scope extends to national and international coverage. The great majority of the chronological scope is post-1900 but there is a representation of 19th century maps in California."

    description: "The Pacifica Radio Archives is one of the oldest and largest collections of non-commercial listener-sponsored public radio programs in world. Chronicling the political, cultural and artistic movements of the second half of the 20th century, Pacifica radio programs include documentaries, performances, discussions, debates, drama, poetry readings, commentaries and radio arts. The Pacifica Radio Archives appraise, collect, organize, describe, and preserve the creative work generated by, or produced in association with, Pacifica Radio, and make it available for research and reference use.  The Archives is delighted to be a part of the California Audiovisual Preservation Project (CAVPP). The two oldest Pacifica Radio sister stations, KPFA-FM and KPFK-FM, are based in Berkeley and Los Angeles, respectively. Over the past sixty years, KPFA and KPFK have borne witness to events in both Northern and Southern California, and have prominently featured the voices of California denizens and community members who were often excluded from both local and national news media. The Archives&#x27; CAVPP collection features actuality from mass demonstrations such as People&#x27;s Park Protest and the International Hotel evictions; incisive public affairs programming about issues that affected Californians of the time, such as the passage of Proposition 13, farm workers&#x27; strikes, and racial segregation in urban communities; interviews with politicians, artists and countercultural figures; and much more. Many of these recordings have not been heard since their initial broadcast on Pacifica airwaves."

    description: "The Saddleback College Digital Archive documents the history of Saddleback College and serves as a repository of the college’s institutional documents. By providing evidence of college activities and events, the Digital Archive tells the story of Saddleback College and helps build an institutional memory. The Digital Archive is a component of the Saddleback College Library. Responsibility for collection development rests with the faculty librarians.  The Digital Archive collects material relevant to Saddleback College and its history. Collections consist primarily of official college documents, including institutional publications, reports, and communications, as well as oral histories, photographs, and other first-hand accounts of campus life and events at the college. The Digital Archive does not serve as a repository of student research, nor does it collect regional material that does not speak directly to the history of Saddleback College. The faculty librarians reserve the right to adjust the scope of the Digital Archive as needed."

In addition to printed materials and administrative records, University Archives includes holdings in other formats: pictorial, maps, audio-visual, and memorabilia. The collection largely dates from the founding of the University in 1868, although it contains some materials pertaining to the College of California (1855-1868). The collection began as a repository of University of California printed documents in the mid 1870s; it was finally designated as repository of University administrative records of historical importance in 1964. The collection consists, with very few exceptions, of English language material."

    name: "UC Irvine, Southeast Asian Archive"
    description: "The University of California, Irvine Libraries established the Southeast Asian Archive in 1987 in response to the community’s interest in having this history documented, preserved, and made accessible. The Archive&#x27;s collection is broad and interdisciplinary in documenting the social, cultural, religious, political, and economic life of members of the Cambodian, Hmong, Laotian, and Vietnamese diaspora. Collection strengths include Southeast Asian American experiences of resettlement and community formations since the Vietnam War, Cambodian Genocide, and geopolitical turmoil in the former French-occupied &quot;Indochina&quot; in the latter half of the 20th century.  The circumstances related to the formation of these diasporic communities, including wars, genocide, and displacement, contribute to the complexities of the Southeast Asian Archive. In particular, records from international aid workers may include information about people who were unknowingly (or non-consentingly) documented and/or depict or describe graphic violence, nudity, as well as racist and/or sexist views. Additionally, these communities originate from countries previously colonized by France and named “Indochina.” As such, some records deploy terms that may be common in government and scholarly publications, but are not adopted or agreed upon by Cambodian, Hmong, Laotian, and Vietnamese people.  These primary source collections are historical and may include descriptive language, personal views, and imagery about and/or in them that are no longer used or considered appropriate today. The acceptability of language and content can change over time. It is possible that a collection or metadata associated with a collection may contain historical language or culturally sensitive content now recognized as inappropriate for publication without meaningful context or consultation with relevant communities.  We are proactively addressing these issues in the UCI Libraries, including ongoing work on reparative, ethical archival description. If you believe that we have archival materials or have published an image or information that is incorrect or that should be restricted, please submit feedback using this form: https://airtable.com/shrOmDhHMDUFlhBVd"

    description: "Beginning in 1913, University of California Cooperative Extension (UCCE) farm advisors have been located in every county of the state and have helped to shape agricultural practices through their work with local farmers, and the development of their communities through programs such as 4-H. In the fall of 2016, under a memorandum of understanding with the University of California’s Division of Agriculture and Natural Resources, the UC Merced Library began to assess, inventory, process, and provide access to historical materials held in county Cooperative Extension offices. Records in the county offices document agricultural trials, animal husbandry, water management, fire management, the development of integrated pest management, rural food and nutrition programs, and youth development programs, among other subjects. The records reflect the partnership between the university and federal, state, and local entities."

    description: "Mount Zion Hospital was established in 1887 by the San Francisco Jewish community as a non-profit hospital. During the flu epidemic of 1918, the hospital treated 100-plus patients a day, and in the 1940s, it provided care to thousands of Jewish refugees. In 1976, the hospital opened the first alternative birth center in San Francisco, and 10 years later opened the city’s first hospital-based comprehensive women’s health center. Mount Zion Hospital began its association with the University of California in the late 1920s, when its medical services expanded significantly and it became a teaching hospital affiliated with UC Medical School (later named UCSF School of Medicine). UCSF acquired the hospital in 1990 and developed the facility over the next few years into a second major clinical site, with an emphasis on outpatient care, under the name UCSF Medical Center at Mount Zion. The UCSF Mount Zion campus serves as an innovative hub of specialized outpatient clinics, surgery, services and comprehensive cancer care."

The Manuscript Collection exists to complement the official holdings of institutional records housed in the Archives. While the collection is not strictly restricted by subject, these materials will usually encompass the following broad subject matter: the practice and science of medicine; biomedical research; healthcare delivery, economics, and administration; health professions education; operations and history of UCSF, its schools, program, and affiliated partners as appropriate; alumni collections including club memorabilia, diaries, photographs, reunion books and scrapbooks. UCSF has the preeminent collection documenting the history of HIV/AIDS epidemic that was started through the UCSF AIDS History Project in 1987 and has been growing even since. The Biotechnology Archives document the leadership of scientists and corporations in the Bay Area in the development and growth of biotechnology. The East Asian Collection is especially strong in works related to the history of Western medicine in Japan from the middle of the 16th century to 1900. It also holds books and journals related to the history of medical societies and medical and pharmacy schools in Japan. Other areas of strength include traditional Chinese medicine, Buddhist medicine, obstetrics and gynecology, and acupuncture. The Japanese Woodblock Print Collection consists of 400 prints and 100 scrolls, dating from 16th to the 20th century."

    description: "Based in the Little Tokyo area of Downtown Los Angeles, the Visual Communications Archives is a repository of 20th Century Asian Pacific American history with unique holdings of photographs, moving image, and oral histories. The holdings include over 300,000 photographic images, 1,500 titles in the Media Resource Library, 100 films and videos produced by Visual Communications, and over 1,000 hours of oral histories. The VC Archives is unique due to the diversity of its collections in pan-Asian content in a variety of formats and subjects.  The Visual Communications collective documented various Asian American social movements and communities in California. Members of Visual Communications not only captured the impassioned times of the movement; their work became an innovative and natural part of the movement as well. Films and videos were used for education and activism that addressed setting up ethnic studies programs on local campuses, city redevelopment issues, the redress campaign for Japanese Americans interned during World War II, and the declaration of martial law in the Philippines. VC’s own past in all media, narrative films, documentaries and educational projects are intertwined with the Asian Pacific American movements of the 1970s, and in itself represents a rich resource for researchers of the Asian Pacific American movements.  The holdings’ focus on Asian Pacific communities here in the U.S., though specific, affirms a culturally pluralistic view of American society. This view resides in the heart of VC’s mission — to promote intercultural understanding through the preservation of our cultures, communities, and histories in America. To date, VC materials have been used in numerous films, videos, educational materials, publications, and major photographic exhibits across the U.S.  For more information, please visit: http://fromthevcvault.wordpress.com/vc-archives-collections/"

    description: "The Wende is an art museum, cultural center, and archive of the Cold War that explores social, political, and cultural change.                  The Wende reaches beyond the conventional walls of a museum in pursuit of international scholarship, artistic interpretation, community engagement, digital access, and experimental public programming.                  Wende is a German word meaning “turning point” or “change” that has come to describe the transformative period around the fall of the Berlin Wall. Founded in 2002, the Wende Museum holds an unparalleled collection of art and artifacts from the Cold War era, which serves as a foundation for programs that illuminate the political and cultural changes of the past, offer opportunities to make sense of a changing present, and inspire active participation in the personal and social changes that will shape the future.                  The Wende fulfills its mission by:             • collecting, preserving, and providing open access to artwork, artifacts, archives, films, and personal histories from the Cold War; • promoting rigorous scholarship, educating students, and stimulating general interest through lectures, symposia, publications, and the digitization of collection material; • presenting innovative exhibitions and interdisciplinary programming inspired by the collection;  • facilitating collaborations with contemporary artists and researchers; • partnering with other non-profit organizations; and • providing community services such as wellness programs, volunteer opportunities, and family- friendly activities.&quot;"

    name: "William E. Colby Memorial Library, Sierra Club"
    description: "The Sierra Club has maintained a library since its beginnings more than a century ago. The Club&#x27;s first library was based on a small collection of mountaineering literature that served John Muir and other mountaineers at the turn of the twentieth century. In San Francisco&#x27;s devastating 1906 earthquake and fire, this early collection was destroyed, but the library was soon reestablished through an outpouring of donations. From those small beginnings the library has grown to accommodate the evolving needs of Sierra Club members. As the Club grew, so did its library. It now holds a significant conservation and mountaineering collection. In 1965, the Library was dedicated as a memorial to William E. Colby , the first secretary of the Sierra Club and a director for forty-nine years. As a reference library, ours is a non-circulating, research collection. Sierra Club members and the public are welcome to use the library as visitors, by appointment. In our reading room at the Club&#x27;s San Francisco headquarters, we provide on-site access to our extensive collection of books, periodicals, mountaineering journals, government documents, historic photographs, slides, maps and memorabilia. Researchers who are unable to visit our library may search the online catalog  for our traditional collections. We respond to reference inquiries regarding Sierra Club publications and history, and will provide photocopies of specific articles if needed. In the 21st century, the Colby Library has expanded online. Our mission is to bring more great content from the Club&#x27;s website to the library&#x27;s holdings."
